Description: |
  Runs the reshardCollection command while the cluster (i.e., the primaries) is saturated by a 
  mixture of CRUD operations to measure the performance impact of resharding operations.

  The workload consists of 5 phases:
    1. Creating an empty sharded collection, distributed across all shards in the cluster.
    2. Populating the sharded collection with the initial data.
    3. Running a mixture of CRUD operations on the collection before resharding the collection.
    4. Running the CRUD workload as the collection is being resharded. 
    5. Running the CRUD workload on the collection after it has been resharded.

  The inserted documents have the following form:
    {_id: 1, oldKey: 2, newKey: 3, counter: 0, padding: 'random string of bytes ...'}

  The collection is initially sharded on {oldKey: hashed} and then resharded on {newKey: 1}.
